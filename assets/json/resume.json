I am adept at utilizing mathematical models and computational methods to analyze complex environmental phenomena.\n\nCurrently, I am engaged in research utilizing Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to observe the eastern edge of the warm pool in the tropical Pacific region. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the processes in the tropical Pacific and the needs of observational systems.\n\nLet's connect to explore potential collaborations or discuss shared interests in environmental science.",

      "summary": "Postdoctoral researcher working at the University of Washington's Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies in collaboration with the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.\n\nI am working with Dr. Yolande Serra (UW CICOES), Dr. Dongxiao Zhang (UW CICOES/NOAA PMEL) and Dr. Meghan Cronin (NOAA PMEL). Our current work is part of a much larger process study to be carried out at the eastern edge of the warm pool (EEWP) and cold tongue regions seeking to address uncertainties in processes regulating sea surface temperatures (SSTs). A key parameter for regulating equatorial SST and the location of the EEWP is upper ocean vertical velocity, which is needed in the calculation of turbulent mixing within the mixed layer and vertical advection of water properties across the base of the mixed layer over a range of time scales. We are investigating the usefulness of acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCPs) on Saildrones for calculating vertical velocity. This work aims to assist in reducing model biases in the eastern tropical Pacific and improving skill in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) predictions.",

      "summary": "Lectured on two courses: ENCH298 and EMTH119. For both, I was responsisble for delivering lectures, providing regular office hours and both writing and marking examinations.\n\nENCH298 is a course for second year chemical and process engineering students. It is designed to amalgamate the mathematics they need along with the applications they will experience in their field. Topics lectured include Laplace and Fourier transforms, Fourier analysis,  multivariate calculus. The course had a single stream of three 1-hour lectures. I delivered all the lectures for 7 weeks of this course.\n\nEMTH119 is a mathematics course for first year engineering students. It has approximately 1000 students and has four 1-hour teaching lectures a week, delivered in two separate streams morning and afternoon giving 8 hours total. For this course, I delivered all lectures for a 3 week section on probability theory. Topics covered include set theory, discrete and random variables, expectation, mean, and variance.",

Topics covered in linear algebra include vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, and orthogonality with applications to Markov chains, population and economic models, least squares approximation, cryptography, coding theory, data compression. Topic in differential systems include systems of linear and non-linear first order differential equations, phase plane techniques, numerical methods, stiff systems, Laplace transforms (including initial value problems, shift theorems, step functions and impulses, convolution, resonance), Fourier series and elementary Fourier transforms.\n\nAt 100 level, I taught across the entire range of offered courses.
