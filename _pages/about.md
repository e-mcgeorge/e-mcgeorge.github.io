_He hiringa hangarau, he oranga tangata._ Innovation in technology, for the benefit of all.

I am an early career researcher in oceanography. My research background is in computational fluid dynamics for inverse problems in geophysical fluid flows, focusing on ice sheet dynamics. I enjoy using mathematical models and computational methods to analyze complex environmental phenomena. Currently, I am researching mixing processes in the tropical Pacific region using observations from Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). My goal is to help advance understanding of ocean dynamics in the tropical Pacific, which will help predict large scale climate events, such as El-Nino Southern Oscillation.
