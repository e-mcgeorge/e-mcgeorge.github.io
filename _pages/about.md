_He hiringa hangarau, he oranga tangata._ Innovation in technology, for the benefit of all.


I am an early career researcher with a Ph.D. in Mathematics. My thesis was in the field of computational fluid dynamics and explored inverse problems methods, such as optimal control, for geophysical fluid flows. I am adept at utilizing mathematical models and computational methods to analyze complex environmental phenomena. Currently, I am engaged in research utilizing Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to observe the eastern edge of the warm pool and estimate upwelling in the tropical Pacific region. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the processes in the tropical Pacific and the needs of observational systems.
